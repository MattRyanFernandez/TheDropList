# TheDropList

Project in the making that will eventually be able to create a drop list that has functionality such as add, delete, sort.
Eventually will be able to out put a list that gives the order the forklift driver should drop the items in to optimize time.
Work done so far is located inside of the master branch in the file TheDropList.py
